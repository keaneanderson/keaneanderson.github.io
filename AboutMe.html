    <p class = "p1">I'm Keane Anderson. I'm a teacher at Math and Science College Prep. I enjoy working here teaching students Engineering and computer Science.
I am also interested in making Youtube videos. This is my favorite way to teach students content. I will put in some content below so you can get a 
taste for what they are like. In the future of my career I hope to continue teaching and serving my students at the highest level I possibly can. I
 also hope to be able to impact the field of education by spreading my video making techniques. Some of my long term goals are to spread an interest 
 mindfulness to the educational community and world at large. Going on meditation retreats have been the most life changing experiences I could ask for
  and I want others to share in this. In my freetime I like to be outside and active,
climing rocks, hiking, and camping. Right is a picture of me Rock Climbing. </p>
